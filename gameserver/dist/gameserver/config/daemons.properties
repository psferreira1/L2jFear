# Preamble:
# Standard set up is possible only two parameters of demons:
# - Pereodichnost run in milliseconds
# - Delay in milliseconds before starting
# Zero or the number of negative values of this trip of a parameter
# For example:
# DeadLockCheck = -1
# Now the demon-stream after completing his tasks will disappear forever.

# CHECK CONNECTION DAEMON:
# Allows you to customize the connection check of players.
CheckConnectionInitial = 300000
CheckConnectionDelay = 900000
# Maximum time without receiving packets from client needed to be checked
# Default: 60sec
CheckConnectionInactivityTime = 60000

# CHECK TELEPORT ZOMBIE STATUS:
# Allow to close connection of "teleport zombies" due to critical errors on teleport
# Default: 60sec
CheckTeleportZombiesDelay = 60000

# Clean database task delay:
# 3600000 miliseconds = 60 minutes
CleanDBInitial = 3600000
# 5400000 miliseconds = 90 minutes
CleanDBDelay = 5400000

# DEAD LOCK CHECK DAEMON:
# Allows to block the flow and see what they blocked
