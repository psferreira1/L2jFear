# Configuration file for dynamic extensions
# Make your own JAR file using JAR CORE of the gameserverr
# Put that NEW JAR inside of libs (gameserver/libs)
# Make sure to put the PATH to the .class FILE, for example. Hello.java (Class when is compiled) in the java package com.test can be loaded like this:
# MyClass = com.test.Hello        <------------ Sample of property
# Notice that MyClass is the name of the "property" (since this file is kind of property file, *.properties)
# Is very important that your property name ENDS WITH "Class", for example: MyClass or bufferClass........ whateverClass
